# Multi-Tenant SaaS Setup Guide

## Overview

The backend has been updated to support multi-tenant SaaS functionality where:
- Each **business** is an **Organization**
- Users belong to one or more Organizations
- All data is isolated per Organization
- Role-based access control (Owner, Admin, Manager, Member)

## Database Schema Updates

The database has been partially updated. You need to complete the migration by:

### Step 1: Organizations Table ✅
Already created with:
- id, name, subdomain, domain
- plan (free, standard, professional, enterprise)
- status, max_users, billing_email

### Step 2: Add organization_id to ALL Tables

Run these SQL commands in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add organization_id to remaining tables
ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS organization_id INTEGER REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS organization_id INTEGER REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE time_logs ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS organization_id INTEGER REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE punch_list_items ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS organization_id INTEGER REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE project_photos ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS organization_id INTEGER REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE inventory_items ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS organization_id INTEGER REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE invoices ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS organization_id INTEGER REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE expenses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS organization_id INTEGER REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE多少次,
```

### Step 3: Create Indexes

```sql
-- Create indexes for organization_id on all tables
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_projects_organization_id ON projects(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tasks_organization_id ON tasks(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_time_logs_organization_id ON time_logs(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_punch_list_items_organization_id ON punch_list_items(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_project_photos_organization_id ON project_photos(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_inventory_items_organization_id ON inventory_items(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_invoices_organization_id ON invoices(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_expenses_organization_id ON expenses(organization_id);
```

### Step 4: Update Invoice Number Uniqueness

```sql
-- Make invoice_number unique per organization
ALTER TABLE invoices DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS invoices_invoice_number_key;
ALTER TABLE invoices ADD CONSTRAINT invoices_org_invoice_number_unique UNIQUE(organization_id, invoice_number);
```

## New Features

### 1. Organization Middleware (`src/middleware/organization.js`)

Middleware for enforcing organization isolation:

- `setOrganizationContext` - Automatically sets organization context from user
- `requireOrganizationMembership` - Ensures user belongs to organization  
- `requireRole('owner', 'admin')` - Checks user role permissions

### 2. Usage in Routes

All routes now automatically filter by organization:

```javascript
import { setOrganizationContext, requireRole } from '../middleware/organization.js';

// All routes use organization context
router.get('/', setOrganizationContext, async (req, res) => {
    const { organizationId } = req;
    
    const result = await pool.query(
        'SELECT * FROM projects WHERE organization_id = $1',
        [organizationId]
    );
    
    res.json(result.rows);
});

// Protect admin-only routes
router.delete('/:id', setOrganizationContext, requireRole('admin', 'owner'), async (req, res) => {
    // Only admins and owners can delete
});
```

## Registration Flow

### Old (Single Organization):
```javascript
POST /api/v1/auth/register
{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password",
    "name": "User",
    "role": "Installer"
}
```

### New (Multi-Tenant):
```javascript
// Step 1: Create organization
POST /api/v1/organizations
{
    "name": "Acme Construction",
    "subdomain": "acme"
}

// Step 2: Create owner user
POST /api/v1/auth/register
{
    "email": "owner@acme.com",
    "password": "password",
    "name": "Owner",
    "organizationId": 1,
    "role": "Owner"
}

// Step 3: Invite team members
POST /api/v1/organizations/1/invites
{
    "email": "worker@acme.com",
    "role": "member"
}
```

## API Routes to Add

Create these new routes:

### Organizations Routes (`src/routes/organizations.js`):
- `GET /organizations` - List user's organizations
- `POST /organizations` - Create organization
- `GET /organizations/:id` - Get organization details
- `PUT /organizations/:id` - Update organization
- `DELETE /organizations/:id` - Delete organization
- `POST /organizations/:id/members` - Add member
- `DELETE /organizations/:id/members/:userId` - Remove member

### Authentication Updates:
- Registration now requires `organizationId`
- Login returns user's organizations
- Context switching between organizations

## Security Considerations

### Data Isolation
- All queries MUST include `WHERE organization_id = $1`
- Never trust client-provided organization IDs
- Organization context set by middleware, not client

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Owner**: Full access, can delete organization
- **Admin**: Manage users and all data
- **Manager**: Manage projects and team
- **Member**: View and create data

### Testing
```bash
# Create organization
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/organizations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name": "Test Corp", "subdomain": "test"}'

# Register user for organization
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/register \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@test.com",
    "password": "password",
    "name": "Admin",
    "organizationId": 1,
    "role": "Admin"
  }'

# Login and get organizations
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/auth/login \
  -d '{"email": "admin@test.com", "password": "password"}'
```

## Todo List

- [ ] Complete database migration (add organization_id to all tables)
- [ ] Update authentication routes for organization context
- [ ] Create organizations CRUD routes
- [ ] Create organization members routes
- [ ] Update all existing routes to use organization context middleware
- [ ] Add organization switching in frontend
- [ ] Add billing/subscription management
- [ ] Implement organization-level features (custom branding, etc.)

## Files Modified

- ✅ `src/middleware/organization.js` - New organization middleware
- ⏳ `src/routes/auth.js` - Needs organization context
- ⏳ All route files - Need organization filtering
- ⏳ `src/db/schema.sql` - Needs complete rewrite
- ⏳ `src/routes/organizations.js` - New file needed
